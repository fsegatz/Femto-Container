# Femto-Containers tutorials

This repository provides a number of tutorials to get familiar with the RIOT
Femto-Container virtual machine.

Femto-Containers is a small virtual machine based on the Linux eBPF
architecture. This makes it suitable for small applications hosted on
microcontroller-type devices.

- [Tutorial 1]

  This tutorial shows how to set up the toolchain and how to get started hosting
  Femto-Container applications on RIOT.

- [Tutorial 2]

  This Tutorial shows somewhat more complex behaviour with a focus on how to
  pass context variables to the container and return values from the container

- [Tutorial 3] (TODO)

  Tutorial 3 shows how to use bindings from the host operating system with
  Femto-Containers.
